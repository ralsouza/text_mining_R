What Exactly is Being Mined?

The non-trivial extraction of novel, implicit, and actionable knowledge from large datasets.

Data

Information

Knowledge

­ Extremely large datasets (GB now and approaching TB) ­ Discovery of the non-obvious ­ Useful knowledge that can improve processes ­ Can not be done manually
Technology to enable data exploration, data analysis, and data visualisation of very large databases at a high level of abstraction, without a specific hypothesis in mind.

Typical Approaches to Data Mining
  Predictive Modelling tree induction, neural nets, regression
  Database Segmentation clustering, k-means, Kohonen maps,
  Link Analysis associations, sequential patterns, similar time sequences
  Deviation Detection visualisation, statistics, outlier detection

The CRISP-DM
  developed by NCR, Daimler-Benz, SPSS, OHRA
  Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining http://www.crisp-dm.org
  Goal: Define and validate a Data Mining Process Model ­ applicable in diverse industry sectors ­ industry and tool neutral ­ large data mining projects executed faster, cheaper, more reliably and more manageably

Data Mining is a Process
  A standard six step iterative process: 1. Business Understanding (25%) 2. Data Understanding (20%) 3. Data Preparation (25%) 4. Modelling (10%) 5. Evaluation (20%) 6. Deployment
  The "fun" has been in the modelling but the hard yakka is in the other steps
  Can Computational Mathematics help us here?

Is Big Brother Watching
  Privacy is an important issue that must be addressed in most Data Mining exercises.
  Laws in many countries directly affect Data Mining and are required knowledge--penalties are often severe.
  The OECD Principles of Data Collection.

ACSys and CSIRO Data Mining
OECD Principles of Data Collection
  Collection limitation:
Data should be obtained lawfully and fairly, while certain very sensitive data should not be held at all
  Data quality:
Data should be relevant to the stated purposes, accurate, complete and up-to-date; proper precautions should be taken to ensure this accuracy
  Purpose specification:
The purposes for which data will be used should be identified, and the data should be destroyed if it no longer serves the given purpose

Copyright c 1999 by Graham J Williams ACSys and CSIRO Data Mining

13

OECD Principles of Data Collection
  Individual participation: The data subject has a right to access and challenge the data related to him or her
  Accountability: A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures giving effect to all these principles

ACSys and CSIRO Data Mining
OECD Principles of Data Collection
  Use limitation:
Use of data for purposes other than specified is forbidden, except with the consent of the data subject or by authority of law
  Security safeguards:
Agencies should establish procedures to guard against loss, corruption, destruction, or misuse of data
  Openness: It must be possible to acquire information about the collection, storage, and use of personal data

  Health Insurance Commission: Medicare Terabytes of patient claims since the inception of Medicare. Using visualisation and hot spot analysis. Exploring public fraud, including doctor shoppers and other inappropriate practices. Moving on to Health Management.
  Australian Taxation Office - ATO Initial project hosted ATO Fraud Prevention and Control employee for 18 months. Assisted evaluation of data mining for fraud detection. Provided ATO with data mining tools developed in the program. Inspired development with VE Program of a profile visualisation tool. Led to a number of investigations by ATO auditors.

Visualisations with Virtual Environments
  Traditional mouse-keyboard-screen well explored   VE dramatically increases workspace   Immersive presentation with new interactive mechanisms   Requires considerable compute power

  NRMA Insurance Ltd Large database of motor vehicle insurance policy histories (millions of records with over 30 usable variables). Decision trees and regression splines form part of the toolkit. Interest in risk rating and premium setting.
  Mt Stromlo Observatory Nightly observations of the intensity of millions of stars over several years. Using Fourier, wavelet and auto regression techniques to extract features. Searching for MACHO events, to detect the missing dark matter of the universe, and performing clustering to find unusual stars.

Hunting for Statistical Outliers: Sofie
  Current collaborative work with NEC Japan
  Parametric Statistical Outlier Detection ­ Gaussian mixture model using Sequentially Discounting EM algorithm
  Non Parametric Statistical Outlier Detection ­ Kernel mixture model using Sequentially Discounting EM
  Application of these on real data feeding further development of algorithm

Data Management
  Data comes in many forms from many locations   Data regularly updated (versioning)   Data Cleansing, Feature Extraction, Feature Derivation
(versioning)   Require tuned, fast access to data   Algorithms want a consistent data model?

27

ACSys and CSIRO Data Mining
Data Management
  Is it possible to separate the algorithm from the data?   Are there classes of data interaction that suit different
algorithms?   How do we best interact with heterogeneous sources of
data?

Delivering the Integrated Application
  Use emerging standards to support delivery of tuned systems:
  Pluggable data mining: ­ Standard API to access data tuned for Data Mining ­ Standard model representations (PMML) ­ Suite of tools to process XML/PMML ­ XML Meta Descriptions of Analysis Tools Input requirements, Tuning Parameters, etc.

ACSys and CSIRO Data Mining
Java Semantic Extension Framework
  Previous work in data management (Application Oriented DB, ODBC/JDBC)
  The "right" abstraction for Data Mining
  Research: Use of the Java SEF (and Persistent Java?) to provide an abstraction for accessing and manipulating data directly suited to the algorithms requirements. (Columnbased access vs Row-based access)
  SEF: seamless access to data, wherever it may be?

Copyright c 1999 by Graham J Williams ACSys and CSIRO Data Mining
Delivering the Integrated Application
  Data Miner's Arcade ­ Java-based prototype environment ­ Provides Dataset API (move towards SEF) ­ Provides algorithm independent GUIs ­ GUIs tuned for algorithms (based on XML/XSL) ­ Scalable algorithms and scalable data management ­ Distributed data not (yet) a focus
