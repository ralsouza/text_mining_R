So What is Data Mining?
The non-trivial extraction of novel, implicit, and actionable knowledge from large datasets. ­ Extremely large datasets ­ Discovery of the non-obvious ­ Useful knowledge that can improve processes ­ Can not be done manually
Technology to enable data exploration, data analysis, and data visualisation of very large databases at a high level of abstraction, without a specific hypothesis in mind.

The Scientist's Motivation
The Real World ­ Offers many challenging problems ­ Enormous databases now exist and readily available
Statistics building models and doing analysis for years? ­ Statistics limited computationally ­ Relevance of statistics if we do not sample ­ There are not enough statisticians to go around!
Machine Learning to build models? ­ Limited computationally, useful on toy problems, but . . .

17

Motivation: The Sizes
Databases today are huge: ­ More than 1,000,000 entities ­ From 10 to 10,000 entities ­ Giga-bytes and tera-bytes
Databases a growing at an unprecendented rate
The corporate world is a cut-throat world ­ Decisions must be made rapidly ­ Decisions must be made with maximum knowledge

ACSys
Discovering Knowledge
The non-trivial extraction of novel, implicit, and actionable knowledge from large datasets. ­ Novel = not previously known ­ Implicit = not easily identifiable ­ Actionable = can act upon the discoveries
Knowledge equates to patterns or models
Generally we are searching for symbolic descriptions of novel and interesting patterns that are contained in the data. These patterns generally apply to a particular area of the database.
30 31

ACSys
The Key is the Hypothesis
Data mining "discovers information without a previously formulated hypothesis:" We don't particularly know what we are looking for. We hope to find un-thought of discoveries. Compare with: ­ SQL Queries ­ Information Retrieval ­ OLAP ­ Exploratory Data Analysis ­ Visualisation ­ Statistics
32
ACSys
Formally
Dataset D of real world entities D = fe1; e2; : : : ; eng. D is relational: RA1; A2; : : : ; Am Each entity is a tuple hv1; v2; : : : ; vmi The number of attributes m and the number of tuples n are typically "large" (m may be anywhere from 20 to 1000 and n
typically greater than 1,000,000)
34

ACSys
Data Mining in a Nutshell
Start with a raw database
 RDBMS or Warehouse
Collect and aggregate variables in a variety of ways
 dataset D
Then mine the data: search for patterns implicit in the data and determining whether they are interesting

Generating Candidate Nuggets

Generate a set of nuggets N = fn1; n2; : : : ; npg

If inducing rules which symbolically describe the nuggets
then we equivalently have R = fr1; r2; : : : ; rpg

Rule might consist of conjunction of conditions:

n so becoming more amenable to human

However, p can still be large (several thousand)

How do we measure the interestingness of a nugget?

Different approaches employ different measures

This question we come back to later

Data Mining is a Process
A standard six step process is being developed: ­ Business Understanding (25%) ­ Data Understanding (20%) ­ Data Preparaation (25%) ­ Modelling (10%) ­ Evaluation (20%) ­ Deployment

ACSys

The CRISP-DM
Being championed by NCR, Daimler-Benz, ISL, OHRA
Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining http://www.ncr.dk/CRISP/index.htm
Define and validate a Data Mining Process Model ­ applicable in diverse industry sectors ­ industry and tool neutral ­ large data mining projects executed faster, cheaper, more
reliably and more manageably
Life cycle of six (iterative) phases.

39

ACSys
Business Understanding
Initial phase focuses on understanding project objectives and requirements from a business perspective
This knowledge is converted into a data mining problem definition
Develop a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives

ACSys
Data Preparation
Construct the mining dataset
Derived from the initial raw dataset(s)
Data preparation tasks: ­ table, record, and attribute selection ­ generation of derived features ­ data transformation ­ data cleaning

41 43

ACSys
Data Understanding
Initial data collection Familiarisation with the data ­ identify data quality problems ­ discover first insights into the data ­ detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden
information
42
ACSys
Preparing to Mine
Data Quality ­ missing data ­ noisy data ­ lead to inconsistent or too general/specific discoveries Data Cleaning ­ duplicates ­ inconsistencies ­ identify and merge the same entities
44

ACSys
Modelling--The Actual Data Mining
Select various modelling techniques Apply and calibrate modelling techniques Typically there are several techniques for the same data mining problem Some techniques have specific requirements on the form of data and require stepping back to the data preparation phase
45
ACSys
Deployment
Deployment may be: ­ Generate a report of the discoveries made ­ Implement changes in the processes of the organisation ­ Implement a repeatable data mining process For successful deployment the customer must understand the actions to be carried out in order to actually make use of the created models
47

ACSys
Evaluation
Evaluate the model and review the steps executed to construct the model Does the model properly achieve the business objectives? Is there some important business issue that has not been sufficiently considered? Decide on the use of the data mining results
46
ACSys
The KDD Process
An interative process, often requiring multiple loops Time consuming process The actual mining is one small step in the whole process Issues in data management are crucial to success

Predictive Modelling: Classification
Goal of classification is to build structures from examples of past decisions that can be used to make decisions for unseen cases. Often referred to as supervised learning. Decision Tree and Rule induction are popular techniques Neural Networks also used
51

ACSys
Data Mining Operations
Predictive Modelling (supervised learning) use observations to learn to predict
Database Segmentation (unsupervised learning) partition data into similar groups
Link Analysis links between individuals rather than characterising whole
Deviation Detection outlier detection: becoming a major focus of data mining

52

ACSys
Decision Tree Induction
Decision tree induction is an example of a recursive partitioning algorithm
Basic motivation: ­ A dataset contains a certain amount of information ­ A random dataset has high entropy ­ Work towards reducing the amount of entropy in the data ­ Alternatively, increase the amount of information exhibited
by the data

ACSys
Algorithm
Construct set of candidate partitions S Select best S* in S
Describe each cell Ci in S* Test termination condition on each Ci
­ true: form a leaf node
­ false: recurse with Ci as new training set

Algorithm

54

ACSys

Discriminating Descriptions

Typical algorithm considers a single attribute at one time:

categorical attributes ­ define a disjoint cell for each possible value: sex = "male"
2­ can be grouped: transport (car, bike)

continuous attributes

­ define many possible binary partitions

­ Split A

A24 and

24

­ Or split A 28 and A 28

56

ACSys

Information Measure

Estimate the gain in information from a particular partitioning of the dataset

A decision tree produces a message which is the decision
P ,The information content is mj=1 pj plog j

­ ­

PSame as entropy: jm=1 pj log1=pj.

57

ACSys
Information Measure
The information that is gained by partitioning T is then:
gainA = infoT  , infoxT 
This gain criterion can then be used to select the partition which maximises information gain Variations of the Information Gain have been developed to avoid various biases: Gini Index of Diversity

59

ACSys

Information Measure

Pinf oT  = ,jm=1 pj plog j is the amount of information
needed to identify class of an object in T

Maximised when all pj are equal

Minimised (0) when all but one pj is 0 (the remaining pj is 1)

ACSys
Pruning
We may be able to build a decision tree which perfectly reflects the data
But the tree may not be generally applicable called overfitting
Pruning is a technique for simplifying and hence generalising a decision tree

61

ACSys

Pruning
How to estimate error? Use a separate test set: ­ Error rate on training set (resubstitution error) not useful
because pruning will always increase error ­ Two common techniques are cost-complexity pruning and
reduced-error pruning
Cost Complexity Pruning: Predicted error rate modelled as weighted sum of complexity and error on training set--the test cases used to determine weighting
Reduced Error Pruning: Use test set to assess error rate directly

63

ACSys
Error-Based Pruning
Replace sub-trees with leaves Decision class is the majority Pruning based on predicted error rates ­ prune subtrees which result in lower predicted error rate
62
ACSys
Issues
Unknown attribute values Run out of attributes to split on Brittleness of method--small perturbations of data lead to significant changes in decision trees Trees become too large and are no longer particularly understandable (thousands of nodes) Data Mining: Accuracy, alone, is not so important
64

ACSys

Classification Rules

A tree can be converted to a rule set by traversing each path

A bc EY <63 >=63 YN
­ A=cY ­ A = b ^ E 63  Y ­ A = b ^ E  63  N ­ Rule Pruning: Perhaps E  63  N

65

ACSys

Recent Research

Bagging
­ Sample with resubstitution from training set ­ Build multiple decision trees from different samples ­ Use a voting method to classify new objects
Boosting
­ Build multiple trees from all training data ­ Maintain a weight for each instance in the training set that
reflects its importance ­ Use a voting method to classify new objects

67

ACSys
Pros and Cons of Decision Tree Induction
Pros ­ Greedy Search = Fast Execution ­ High dimensionality not a problem ­ Selects important variables ­ Creates symbolic descriptions
Cons ­ Search space is huge ­ Interaction terms not considered
­ Parallel axis tests only (A = v)

66

ACSys

Predictive Modelling: Regression
Linear Regression ­ Limited use and biased by outliers
Non-Linear Regression ­ Difficult with high dimensional data
Radial Basis Functions ­ More robust and flexible ­ Weighted sum of non-linear functions, each fitted to

Database Segmentation: Clustering
Definition:
­ Given n entities find a useful partition into p subsets
Numerical Clustering ­ Usually easier since distance easy to calculate ­ For example, Euclidean distance
Conceptual Clustering ­ Targets the derivation of the cluster ­ Symbolic descriptions ­ Can handle non-numeric data

Link Analysis: Association Rules
A technique developed specifically for data mining ­ Given
 A dataset of customer transactions  A transaction is a collection of items
­ Find
 Correlations between items as rules
Examples ­ Supermarket baskets ­ Attached mailing in direct marketing

70 72

ACSys
Determining Interesting Association Rules
Rules have confidence and support ­ IF x and y THEN z with confidence c
 if x and y are in the basket, then so is z in c% of cases
­ IF x and y THEN z with support s
 the rule holds in s% of all transactions

ACSys
Typical Application
Hundreds of thousands of different items Millions of transactions Many gigabytes of data It is a large task, but linear algorithms exist

While p is generally much smaller than n (p n) it can still be substantial (perhaps one or two thousand for n in the millions). p generally remains too large for manual
consideration.

Fitness = Interestingness
We cast our problem to that of searching for a collection of data subsets (described by rules) which we find interesting
ROur rule set can serve as a starting point for the
search (although randomly generated starting points could be used). If we can define what we mean by interesting then we could use that as out fitness measure to evolve a fitter collection of rules.
104

ACSys

Interestingness

We are drowning in a wealth of "discoveries"
Visualisation is not enough--VR beginning to help.
Still need a better way to help us interactively explore through the space of possible groupings of the data.
Combined with VR to provide a data driven yet user controlled exploratory data mining system
We need a way of better exploring the space and identifying interestingness more formally.

103

ACSys
Rule Induction
Rule Evolution is not new, but We do not seek rule accuracy in the usual sense We do not seek coverage in the usual sense
Instead we seek a collection of rules that describe different regions of the database and are interesting.

105

ACSys
Specifying Interestingness
Specifying interestingness is now the difficult task. There are many aspects to take into account. The domain user will essentially refine their idea of interestingness as they proceed in their exploration Keep the domain user in the look: In an evolutionary sense, maintain them as the oracle to decide fitness of the interestingness measure

106

ACSys
An Architecture for Evolutionary Hot Spots

h a formal language for expressing interestingness we can now explore the evolution of fitness measure itself, allowing the data driven discoveries to be assessed by the domain r, whose input is captured to evolve measures of interestingness which are then employed evolve new nuggets!

How to Capture Interestingness

We can capture interestingness as some formula involving:
­ Distance A measure of how far a group prototype is from the population prototype.
­ Template A pattern that is used to increase the interestingness measure.
­ Belief Well know truths of the domain to check for surprising discoveries.
­ Sizes Size of corresponding dataset and complexity of rule

Spatial Data Mining
Spatial Inforation Systems (and GIS) now common technology Spatial Databases store Spatially Indexed data Again, in Data Mining we tend to factor space out! How can we use spatial information directly in Data Mining?

ACSys
Feature Selection
Once we have the right features data mining is trivial! But how do we best aggregate the source features? ­ Aggregate transactions in some way:
number of transactions every 3 months number of different types of transactions ­ Aggregate spatial data appropriately: in particular census collection disctrict But the aggregations encapsulate preconceived ideas

Privacy and Data Mining
Laws in many countries directly affect Data Mining, and it is worth being aware of them--penalties are often severe. The OECD Principles of Data Collection are relevant.

ACSys
OECD Principles of Data Collection
Collection limitation: Data should be obtained lawfully and fairly, while some very sensitive data should not be held at all Data quality: Data should be relevant to the stated purposes, accurate, complete and up-to-date; proper precautions should be taken to ensure this accuracy Purpose specification: The purposes for which data will be used should be identified, and the data should be destroyed if it no longer serves the given purpose
125

ACSys
OECD Principles of Data Collection
Use limitation: Use of data for purposes other than specified is forbidden, except with the consent of the data subject or by authority of law Security safeguards: Agencies should establish procedures to guard against loss, corruption, destruction, or misuse of data Openness: It must be possible to acquire information about the collection, storage, and use of personal data
