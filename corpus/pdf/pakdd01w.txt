Abstract. This study proposes a data mining framework to discover qualitative and quantitative patterns in discrete-valued time series (DTS). In our method, there are three levels for mining similarity and periodicity patterns. At the first level, a structuralbased search based on distance measure models is employed to find pattern structures; the second level performs a value-based search on the discovered patterns using local polynomial analysis; and then the third level based on hidden Markov-local polynomial models (HMLPMs), finds global patterns from a DTS set. We demonstrate our method on the analysis of "Exchange Rates Patterns" between the U.S. dollar and the United Kingdom Pound.

Keywords. temporal data mining, discrete-valued time series, similarity patterns, periodicity analysis, local polynomial modelling, hidden Markov models.

1 Introduction
Temporal data mining is concerned with discovering qualitative and quantitative temporal patterns in a temporal database or in a discrete-valued time series (DTS) dataset. DTS commonly occur in temporal databases (e.g., the weekly salary of an employee, or a daily rainfall at a particular location). We identify two kinds of major problems that have been studied in temporal data mining:
1. The similarity problem: finding fully or partially similar patterns in a DTS, and 2. The periodicity problem: finding fully or partially periodic patterns in a DTS.
Although there are various results to date on discovering periodic patterns and similarity patterns DTS datasets (e.g. [4]), a general theory and general method of data analysis of discovering patterns for DTS data analysis is not well known.
Our proposed framework is based on a new model for discovering patterns by using hidden Markov models and local polynomial modelling. The first step of the framework consists of a distance measure function for discovering structural patterns (shapes). In this step, the rough shapes of patterns are only decided from the DTS and a distance measure is employed to compute the nearest neighbors (NN) to, or the closest candidates of, given patterns among the similar ones selected. In the second step, the degree of similarity and periodicity between the extracted patterns is measured based on local polynomial models. The third step of the framework consists of a hidden Markov-local

polynomial model for discovering all levels patterns based on results from the first two steps.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the definitions and basic methods of hidden Markov models and local polynomial modelling. Section 3 presents our new method of hidden Markov-local polynomial models (HMLPM). Section 4 applies new models to "Daily Foreign Exchange Rates" data and section 5 discusses related work. The final section concludes the paper with a short summary.

2 Definitions and Basic Methods

We first give a definition of what we mean by DTS and some other notations will be

introduced later. The basic models will be given here and studied in detail in the rest of

the paper.

We assume that for every successive pair of two time points in DTS, ( 7ih   - p7 = qr"p#

is a function (in most cases, rq "p # = consta3 nt).3 For ev3 ery successive three observations: t2 s , 2¤s'h   and 2¤'s h ¡ , the triple value of ( s , 's h ,  's h ¡ ) has only nine distinct states

(called local features) depending on changes in value.

Let state: wu v be the same state as the prior one, wu x the go-up state compared with

A sequence is called a full periodic sequence if every point in time contributes

(precisely or approximately) to the cyclic behavior of the overall time series (that is,

there are cyclic patterns with the same or different periods of repetition).

A sequence is called a partial periodic sequence if the behavior of the sequence is

periodic at some but not all points in the time series.

the sequence h is called a Structural Base sequence and a subsequence of h is called

a sub-Structural Base sequence. If any subsequence vx of  is a periodic sequence,

then vx is called a sub-structural periodic sequence,  also is a structural periodic

sequence (existence periodic pattern(s)).

2.2 Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

In a hidden Markov model (HMM) an underlying and unobserved sequence of states

follows a Markov chain with a finite state space and the probability distribution of the

observation at any time is determined only by the current state of that Markov chain.

In this subsection we briefly introduce the hidden Markov time series models which is

limited to standard results taken from the literature. We have in particular used those of

2.3 Local Polynomial Models (LPMs)

The key idea of local modelling is explained in the context of least squares regression

models. We use standard results from the local polynomial analysis theory which can be

found from the literature on linear polynomial analysis (e.g, [8]). Recall the data model

function given earlier: Y A RP X#wSUW X#9X where Y5fgX # = 0, ac¢b ed fgX # = 1, and 2 and X

3 Hidden Markov-Local Polynomial models (HMLPMs)

A real-world temporal dataset may contain different kinds of patterns such as com-

plete and partial similarity patterns and periodicity patterns, and complete or partial

different order patterns. There are many different techniques for efficient sequence or

subsequence matching to find patterns in discrete-valued time series database (DTSB)

(e.g, [1]). A limitation of those techniques is also that they do not provide a coher-

ent language for expressing prior knowledge and handling uncertainty in the matching

process. Also the existence of different patterns does not guarantee the existence of an

explicit model.

In this section we introduce our new data mining model for pattern analysis in a

DTS by a combination of the hidden Markov models (HMMs) and local polynomial

models (LPMs), called hidden Markov-local polynomial models (HMLPMs). HMMs

have been successfully used in many applications, such as in isolated word recognition

(see [7]), but they have two major limitations. One is HMMs often have a large number

of unstructured parameters, and the other is they cannot express dependencies between

hidden states. In order to overcome the limitations of HMMs we apply local polynomial

modelling techniques to relax the restrictive form of a HMM. We combine HMMs and

LPMs to form hybrid models that contain the expressive power of artificial LPMs with

the sequential time series aspect of HMMs.

For building up our new data mining model we divide the data sequence or data

vector sequence into two groups: (1) the structural-base data group and (2) the pure

value-based data group. In group one we only consider the data sequence as a 9-state

structural sequence by applying a distance measure function for performing structural

pattern search. In group two, we use local polynomial techniques on the pure value-

based sequence data for discovering pure value-based patterns. Then we combine those

two groups by using hidden Markov models to obtain the final results.

3.1 Modelling DTS

Without loss of generality we assume that for each successive pair of time points in a DTS, we have p 7 h   -  7 =   (a unit constant). According to our method the structural base sequence and value-point process data model become:

Then the problem of value-point pattern discovery can be formulated as the local

3.2 Structural Pattern Discovery

We now introduce an approach to discovering patterns in structural base sequences

which uses a distance measure function with its density estimator.

From the point of view of our method in structural sequence data analysis, we

use squared distance functions quadratic forms. Specifically, if

4 Experimental Results
This section presents selected experimental results. There are three steps of experiments for the investigation of "Daily Foreign Exchange Rates"4 analysis of "Exchange Rates Patterns" between the U. S. dollar and the U. K. pound. The data consist of daily exchange rate for each business day between 2 January 1971 and 21 June 1999. The time series is plotted in figure 1.

In Figure 2, each point represents the occurence of one of the nine transition states, retaining the original order of the states. There exist two approximation uniformly distributed on state 3 and state 7 if the observations are big enough. Figure 2 also explains two facts: (1) there exists a hidden periodic distribution which corresponds to patterns on the same line with different distances, and (2) there exist partial periodic patterns on and between the same lines. To explain this further, we can look at the plot of distances between the patterns at a finer granularity over a selected portion of the daily exchange rates. For instance, in the right of Figure 2 the dataset consists of daily exchange rates for 300 business days starting from 3 January 1983, telling us there exist a number of partial periodic patterns appearing in each year and, also telling us in each state in a

year there is a hidden periodic and similarity distribution with each point representing

the distance of patterns of various forms. Between some combined pattern classes there

exist similar patterns such as between 5 to 10 and 15 to 22; between 32 to 35 and 42 to

44.

In Figure 3 the x-axis represents how many times the same distance is found be-

tween repeating patterns and the y-axis represents the distance between the first and

second occurences of each repeating pattern. In other words, we classify repeating pat-

terns based on a distance classification technique. Again we can look at the plot over a

selected portion to observe the distribution of distances in more detail. For example, in

the right of figure 3 the dataset consists of daily exchange rates for the first 50 business

In summary, some results for the structural base experiments are as follows:

­ Structural distribution is a hidden periodic distribution with a periodic length func-

tion rq "p # (there are techniques available to approximate to the form of this function

such as higher-order polynomial functions).

­ There exist some partial periodic patterns based on a distance shifting.

('sequence for searching periodic and similarit y patterns. The linear regression of value-
point of 2  against 2    explains about 8! ! of the variability of the data sequence,

5 Related Work
According to pattern theory objectives in pattern searching can be classified into three categories:
­ Create a representation in terms of algebraic systems with probabilistic superstructures intended for the representation and understanding of patterns in nature and science.
­ Analyse the regular structures from the perspectives of mathematical theory. ­ Apply regular structures to particular applications and implement the structures by
algorithms and code.
In recent years various studies have considered temporal datasets for searching different kinds of and/or different levels of patterns. These studies have only covered one or two of the above categories. For example, many researchers use statistical techniques such as Metric-distance based techniques, Model-based techniques, or a combination of techniques (e.g, [14]) to search for different pattern problems such as in periodic patterns searching (e.g., [9]) and similarity pattern searching (e.g., [6]).
¢  ¡Some studies have covered the above three categories for searching patterns in data
mining. For instance [2] presents a "shape definition language", called  , for retrieving objects based on shapes contained in the histories associated with these objects. Also [12] present a logic algorithm for finding and representing hidden patterns. In [5], authors described adaptive methods which are based on similar methods for finding rules and discovering local patterns.
Our work is different from these works. First, we use a statistical language to perform all the search work. Second, we divide the data sequence or, data vector sequence, into two groups: one is the structural base group and the other is the pure value based group. In group one our techniques are similar to Agrawal's work but we only consider three state changes (i.e., up (value increases), down (value decreases) and same (no change)) whereas Agarwal considers eight state changes (i.e., up (slightly increasing value), Up (highly increasing value), down (slightly increasing value) and so on). In this group, we also use distance measuring functions on structural based sequences which is similar to [12]. In group two we apply statistical techniques such as local polynomial modelling to deal with pure data which is similar to [5]. Finally, our work combines significant information of two groups to get global information which is behind the dataset.
6 Concluding Remarks
This paper has presented a new approach combining hidden Markov models and local polynomial analysis to form new models of application of data mining. The rough decision for pattern discovery comes from the structural level that is a collection of certain predefined similarity patterns. The clusters of similarity patterns are computed in this

level by the choice of certain distance measures. The point-value patterns are decided in the second level and the similarity and periodicity of a DTS are extracted. In the final level we combine structural and value-point pattern searching into the HMLPM model to obtain a global pattern picture and understand the patterns in a dataset better. Another approach to find similar and periodic patterns has been reported else where [10, 11]. With these the model used is based on hidden periodicity analysis and plocal polynormial analysis. However, we have found that using different models at different levels produces better results.
The "Daily Foreign Exchanges Rates" data was used to find the similar patterns and periodicities. The existence of similarity and partially periodic patterns are observed even though there is no clear full periodicity in this analysis.
The method guarantees finding different patterns if they exist with structural and valued probability distribution of a real-dataset. The results of preliminary experiments are promising and we are currently applying the method to large realistic data sets such as two kinds of diabetes dataset.
