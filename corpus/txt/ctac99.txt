What Exactly is Being Mined?

And Where Has it Come From?

The non-trivial extraction of novel, implicit, and actionable
knowledge from large datasets.

Mathematics

– Extremely large datasets (GB now and approaching TB)
– Discovery of the non-obvious
– Useful knowledge that can improve processes
– Can not be done manually
Technology to enable data exploration, data analysis, and data
visualisation of very large databases at a high level of abstraction, without
a specific hypothesis in mind.

Typical Approaches to Data Mining

Data Mining is a Process
A standard six step iterative process:

Predictive Modelling
tree induction, neural nets, regression

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Database Segmentation
clustering, k-means, Kohonen maps,
Link Analysis
associations, sequential patterns, similar time sequences

Business Understanding (25%)
Data Understanding (20%)
Data Preparation (25%)
Modelling (10%)
Evaluation (20%)
Deployment

The “fun” has been in the modelling but the hard yakka is in
the other steps

Deviation Detection
visualisation, statistics, outlier detection

Can Computational Mathematics help us here?

Is Big Brother Watching
Privacy is an important issue that must be addressed in
most Data Mining exercises.
Laws in many countries directly affect Data Mining and are
required knowledge—penalties are often severe.

Goal: Define and validate a Data Mining Process Model
– applicable in diverse industry sectors
– industry and tool neutral
– large data mining projects executed faster, cheaper, more
reliably and more manageably

OECD Principles of Data Collection

OECD Principles of Data Collection

Collection limitation:

Use limitation:

Data should be obtained lawfully and fairly, while certain very sensitive
data should not be held at all

Use of data for purposes other than specified is forbidden, except with
the consent of the data subject or by authority of law

Security safeguards:

Data quality:
Data should be relevant to the stated purposes, accurate, complete and
up-to-date; proper precautions should be taken to ensure this accuracy

Agencies should establish procedures to guard against loss, corruption,
destruction, or misuse of data

Purpose specification:

Openness:
It must be possible to acquire information about the
collection, storage, and use of personal data

The purposes for which data will be used should be identified, and the
data should be destroyed if it no longer serves the given purpose

Australian Taxation Office - ATO
Initial project hosted ATO Fraud Prevention and Control employee for
18 months. Assisted evaluation of data mining for fraud detection.
Provided ATO with data mining tools developed in the program. Inspired
development with VE Program of a profile visualisation tool. Led to a
number of investigations by ATO auditors.

Data Management

Traditional mouse-keyboard-screen well explored

Data comes in many forms from many locations

VE dramatically increases workspace

Data regularly updated (versioning)

Immersive presentation with new interactive mechanisms

Data Cleansing, Feature Extraction, Feature Derivation
(versioning)

Requires considerable compute power
Require tuned, fast access to data
Algorithms want a consistent data model?

Data Management

Java Semantic Extension Framework

Is it possible to separate the algorithm from the data?

Previous work in data management
(Application Oriented DB, ODBC/JDBC)

Are there classes of data interaction that suit different
algorithms?

The “right” abstraction for Data Mining

How do we best interact with heterogeneous sources of
data?

Research: Use of the Java SEF (and Persistent Java?) to
provide an abstraction for accessing and manipulating data
directly suited to the algorithms requirements. (Columnbased access vs Row-based access)
SEF: seamless access to data, wherever it may be?
